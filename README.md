Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Introduction

Credit card fraud has become one of the most rapidly evolving financial crimes in the world today, presenting significant challenges for individuals and businesses globally. The increasing use of credit cards for both online and offline transactions has created an opportunity for fraudsters to exploit vulnerabilities in payment systems, using highly sophisticated methods. 

This project aims to develop machine learning models with different prediction algorithms and compare their results. The objective is to build models that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and decline them. Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines(SVM), and Random Forest will be used and the results will be compared for the best-performing model.
